                <p class="text-ring">The Ring is a 2002 American psychological supernatural horror film directed by Gore
                    Verbinski from a screenplay by Ehren
                    Kruger, and starring Naomi Watts, Martin Henderson and Brian Cox. It is a remake of Hideo Nakata's
                    1998 film Ring, based
                    on Koji Suzuki's 1991 novel of the same name. The plot centers on Rachel Keller, a journalist who
                    must figure out a way
                    to escape death after watching a cursed videotape that seemingly kills the viewer seven days after
                    viewing it.</p>

                <h2 class="story-title">Plot</h2>
                <p class="text-ring">
                    The Ring was released theatrically by DreamWorks Pictures on October 18, 2002, receiving moderately
                    positive reviews,
                    with critics praising the atmosphere and visuals, Bojan Bazelli's cinematography, Verbinski's
                    direction and Watts'
                    performance. The Ring was a box-office success, grossing $249.3 million on a production budget of
                    $48 million, making it
                    one of the highest-grossing horror remakes of all time.

                    The film is the first installment of the American Ring series, and is followed by The Ring Two
                    (2005) and Rings (2017).
                    The success of The Ring paved the way for American remakes of several other Asian and Japanese
                    horror films, including
                    The Grudge (2004) and Dark Water (2005).</p>
                <p class="text-ring">Teenage girls Katie and Becca discuss an urban legend about a cursed videotape that
                    causes whoever watches it to die in
                    seven days. That night, Katie, who watched it a week ago, is killed by an unseen force.

                    At Katie's funeral, her mother asks her sister Rachel, a Seattle-based journalist, to investigate
                    her daughter's death.
                    Rachel discovers that Katie's friends all died in bizarre accidents at the exact same time and night
                    of Katie's death.
                    Rachel goes to the Shelter Mountain Inn, where Katie and her friends watched the tape. She finds and
                    watches the tape;
                    it contains strange and frightening imagery. She then receives a phone call from an unknown caller
                    who whispers, "seven
                    days". Though initially skeptical, Rachel quickly begins to experience supernatural occurrences
                    linked with the tape.</p>
                <p class="text-ring">Rachel recruits the help of her video analyst ex-boyfriend Noah. He watches the
                    tape and Rachel makes him a copy. She
                    identifies a woman on the tape: horse breeder Anna Morgan, who killed herself after some of her
                    horses drowned
                    themselves off Moesko Island. Rachel and Noah's young son Aidan ends up watching the tape. Aidan
                    also possesses some
                    supernatural abilities, which he uses to help with Rachel's investigation.

                    Rachel heads for Moesko Island to speak to Anna's widower Richard, while Noah travels to Eola
                    Psychiatric Hospital to
                    view Anna's medical files. Rachel discovers that Anna had adopted a girl, Samara, who possessed the
                    ability to
                    psychically etch images onto objects and into people's minds, tormenting her parents and their
                    horses. Noah finds a
                    psychiatric file on Samara that mentions a missing video record last seen by Richard.

                    Returning to the Morgan home, Rachel finds a birth certificate proving that Samara is the biological
                    child of Richard
                    and Anna. She also finds the missing video, in which Samara explains her powers during a therapy
                    session. Richard
                    insists that Samara is evil and commits suicide by electrocuting himself. Noah and Rachel find a
                    loft in the barn, which
                    the Morgans used to isolate Samara from themselves and the outside world. There is an image of a
                    tree behind the
                    wallpaper; Rachel recognizes it as a tree at the Shelter Mountain Inn.

                    They return to Shelter Mountain Inn, where they are led to a well beneath the floorboards. Rachel
                    falls inside and
                    experiences a vision of Anna dumping Samara into the well, where she survived for seven days.
                    Samara's body surfaces
                    from the water. After Rachel is rescued, they arrange a proper burial for Samara.

                    Back home, Aidan warns Rachel that it was a mistake to help Samara. Rachel realizes that Noah's
                    seven days are up;
                    Samara's ghost crawls out of his TV screen and kills him. Unable to deduce why she was spared,
                    Rachel realizes that the
                    tape seen by Aidan was a copy she'd created. She also realizes that Samara's endgame is to spread
                    her curse as far as
                    possible. Rachel saves Aidan by having him make another copy to show someone else. The film ends
                    with Aidan asking what
                    will happen to the person who watches the copy they're crafting, to which Rachel does not answer.

                <h3 class="title-h3">Development and casting</h3>
                <p class="text-ring">The Ring went into production without a completed script.[5] Ehren Kruger wrote
                    three drafts of the screenplay before
                    Scott Frank came on to do an uncredited re-write. Gore Verbinski was initially inspired to do a
                    remake of Ring after
                    Walter F. Parkes sent him a VHS copy of the Japanese film, which he described as "intriguing",
                    "pulp" and "avant-garde".
                    The original WGA-approved credits listed Hiroshi Takahashi (writer of the original 1998 screenplay
                    for Ring) but his
                    name is absent from the final print.

                    Several high-profile actresses were offered the lead role, including Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer
                    Connelly and Kate
                    Beckinsale.[6] Verbinski admitted to not wanting to cast "big stars" as he wanted his film to be
                    "discovered" and
                    describes the wave of harsh criticism from hardcore fans of the original Japanese film as
                    "inevitable", although he
                    expressed desire for them to find the remake equally compelling. He also sought to retain the
                    minimalism prevalent
                    throughout Ring and set it in Seattle, due to its "wet and isolated" atmosphere.[5]</p>
                <h2 class="title-h2">Filming</h2>
                <p class="text-ring">The Ring was filmed in 2001, primarily in the State of Washington in numerous
                    locations, including Seattle, Port
                    Townsend, Whidbey Island, Bellingham, Monroe and Stanwood.[7] The Yaquina Head Lighthouse in
                    Newport, Oregon, was also
                    used as a filming location,[8] as well as Oregon's Columbia River Gorge.

                    Chris Cooper played a murderer in two scenes meant to bookend the film, but was ultimately cut.[4]
